## 📌 Overview

This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a **Citizen Engagement System** designed to improve how complaints and feedback on public services are submitted, routed, tracked, and resolved.

Currently, complaints are often managed through fragmented and inefficient systems. This solution streamlines the process, enhancing **usability, accountability, and response time** across government institutions.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The application follows a simple, effective **3-step workflow**:

1. **📝 Submission**  
   Citizens can submit a complaint or feedback by filling out a form. They must select the **appropriate agency** to route their submission accurately. This design makes it reliable for users to control where their issue is sent.

2. **📤 Review by Agency**  
   Once submitted, the selected government agency can view the complaint via an **admin dashboard**. If the submission is pending, they have an option to **respond** directly.

3. **📈 Tracking**  
   Citizens can track the **status of their complaint**, seeing whether it’s still pending or has been responded to.

   ✅ **A cool feature:** After submission, the user is provided with a **unique tracking ID** which they can use to check their complaint's status at any time.
