## 📌 Overview

This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a **Citizen Engagement System** designed to improve how complaints and feedback on public services are submitted, routed, tracked, and resolved.

Currently, complaints are often managed through fragmented and inefficient systems. This solution streamlines the process, enhancing **usability, accountability, and response time** across government institutions.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The application follows a simple, effective **3-step workflow**:

1. **📝 Submission**  
   Citizens can submit a complaint or feedback by filling out a form. They must select the **appropriate agency** to route their submission accurately.

2. **📤 Review by Agency**  
   The selected government agency can view the complaint via an **admin dashboard** and respond accordingly.

3. **📈 Tracking & Notification**  
   - A **unique tracking ID** is generated for each submission.
   - Citizens can use this ID to **track the complaint's status** anytime.
   - When an agency **responds**, the citizen is **notified via email** and can view the response on the tracking page.
